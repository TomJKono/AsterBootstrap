Description: This package contains wrapper functions that were developed with
    the goal of improving the usability and accessiblity of Aster models for
    estimation of total lifetime fitness. It also includes functions for using
    parallel computing resources to perform a parametric bootstrap to assess
    the variability of the point estimates for fitness and genetic variance
    obtained from Aster models.
